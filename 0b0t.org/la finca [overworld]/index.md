## Description
La Finca is a Minecraft base founded by xPRITZKERx in May 2020.\
It was started when xPRITZKERx left spawn to create a base that would serve the purpose of being a symbol for 2b2t on another server.\
The base La Finca was named after the Spanish translation "The Farm".\
\
It stood as a symbol for some of the famous 2b2t bases and groups:\
- The Followers of the Crafting Table\
- Melon base\
- Space Valkyria 3\
- Mushroom Kingdom\
- Imperator's Base

## Additional Info
The base consisted of several sections, where each one was connected to one of the above mentioned groups.\
You had Mushroom biome, Melon biome, crafting table biome and an end biome.\
\
The base also included a map art section mostly build by Beanella, SlarSS and xPRITZKERx, a dupe stash containing approximately 6000 double chests, a collection of around 700+ map arts and other small bases.\
There were also plenty of pixel arts of artist such as: Lil Peep, Mac Miller, SuicideBoys and other video game characters: Teemo, Warhammer, etc.
