## Description
The stash used by 2b2t's Block Game Mecca's members.

## Additional Info
This base plays a special role in the illegals history of 0b0t. Since 2b2t world-downloads were transferred to 0b0t's map when 0bOp took over, 
NIGHTRUNNER_ and TransAreObjects decided to check thearchive.world for interesting bases. What they found was shocking; this stash, containing stacked leggings (in a stack of 59) in a chest.
They immediately flew over to the stash on 0b0t, and upon arrival, blew up the chest containing the stacked leggings (as to not make it revert when opening it).
The anti illegals plugin at the time struggled with reverting overstacked items when picking them up from the ground, 
so they were able to open a shulker with InventoryMove enabled, pick the stacked leggings up and transfer them inside. 
Repeating the process with the placed shulker box, they were able to move the stacked leggings back to their base at the time, Trannyland 3.
