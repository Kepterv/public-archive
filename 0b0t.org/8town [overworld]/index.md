## Description
- 8town was a base founded by BlxckFalcon and atpYT, it was a based that consisted of every single big name / cool person who ever played the server 8b8t.xyz. The base was a mishmash of random ass schematics and world downloads, inspired by star gazers.

## Additional Info
- The base was griefed by GoogleComStuff, due to apparently - one of his friends being doxed by an 8town member? It's thought that the player that was doxed was futur5, as the base was griefed no more then 2 days after they were invited. Griefed august 2nd 2023.
