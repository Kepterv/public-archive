## Description
In March of 2021, the players Vhcvssc and Willow0092 decided to create a base together.\
They invited the players NIGHTRUNNER_ and supersilver230 and started working. Soon, it became the main base for the now defunct group Zoe Corp. With many core members being invited, construction was fast.\
The center of the base was chosen to be a grandiose hub with lots of details. This was built by Willow0092, the fastest schematic builder at the base. If you threw a task at Willow, it would be done.\
\
Midway through the building of Atrium, 0b0t shut down, after a meltdown of the server owner 0bOp.\
The group members thought that was the end of the base, but a week later, 0b0t was back. The base was about to see progress like no other.\
\
supersilver230, the designer of the base, designed most of the builds that played a crucial part in keeping the base together.\
Arrow25, also known as \_\_59, designed and built a giant chessboard. He was known as the most detailed designer at the base and everything he made had the utmost attention to detail.\
\
In about two weeks, Atrium had become one of the biggest bases on the server, only challenged by the likes of La Finca.\
After so much building, the builders were burnt out and the base lay dormant for months, only being used for the testing of random exploits.\
\
After months of the base having no progress, it started to fall apart. Since the base was built so close to the world border, it was found by a base hunter, but the group members managed to convince him to not leak or grief the base.\
But the real nail in the coffin of Atrium was when members began fighting. This ultimately led to it being griefed by 10K10K, known as one of the server's biggest Griefers.\
\
Though Atrium was great, Zoe Corp went on to create many more great bases.
