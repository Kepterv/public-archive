Repository of the entire anarchived public archive (wiki only, excluding region files and map data).

# Writing information

# Base Name

## Additional Info
If there is more info that should be separated or is less important just put it here

## Sources
- Person who provided the wdl
- Person who wrote the info (probably you)
- Other sources
```
Closely follow this format when writing information. To see an example, look at the wiki. One page with a lot of information is about the base [Atrium](./0b0t.org/atrium%20[overworld]/index.md).

## Guidelines
- Try to include a *precise* location, not just a general X / Z of where the base approximately is located. This position is used by the anarchived plugin to decide where players should be teleported when vising a base.
- Don't include commas in coordinates. Follow the format X Y Z
- Follow the date format MM/DD/YYYY for any dates.
- Additional Info is not required.
- Capitalize All Words In The Base Name.
- Put question marks, explicit remarks, or an all-caps TODO for information you don't know or haven't gotten yet.
- Include all sources you know of. Don't be afraid to credit yourself here, so people know you provided this information.
- Don't include region files. Use the discord server for that and open a ticket there to provide your actual world-download (if applicable)
- Be as objective as possible. Don't spread lies.

When you are finished with your information, follow the directory structure conventions:
```sh
# this is your directory name, dedicated to the base you wrote your information for.
base name all lowercase [dimension]
  └─ index.md # this is your information file. always name it index.md and include it directly under the base directory.
  └─ .pictures # this is an optional directory, containing additional images or screenshots of the base.
```

# Contributing
To contribute the information you have written, you have two possibilities:

## Using GitHub
This is the most straightforward way. To request to change / update information on the wiki, simply fork the repository, edit what you need, and create a pull request. We will make sure your contribution is good to go. If it's all set, your contribution will appear here.

## Using the Discord server
If you haven't worked with git before, thats alright too. Simply join [the discord server](https://discord.gg/pZnZN27Gss) if you haven't already, and create a ticket in the #contribute channel. Please describe your contribution or directly send it, you do not need to wait for the maintainers to come and help.
