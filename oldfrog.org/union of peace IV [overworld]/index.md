## Description
UoPIV, the 4th base of the Union of Peace. At the time, it was the largest base on the server by member count with almost 20 members including several notable players. 
There were also several maparts created at the base and a banner collection. UoP was infamous for buying an end portal from John (the server's admin), which also funded the server for 6 months. 
This would be the first end portal that TWISTEDINSANE acquired. There was also a "void chunk" where they removed bedrock and several large builds. 
\
The end of the base happened when some drama and miscommunication happened between zxnyy and the other base members that resulted in zxnyy leaking the base.
After UoPIV was griefed in February (?) of 2022, Uop V was founded.
