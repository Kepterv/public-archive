## Description
UoPIV, the 4th base of the Union of Peace. At the time, it was the largest base on the server by member count with almost 20 members including several notable players. There were also several maparts created at the base and a banner collection. UoP was infamous for buying an end portal from John (the server's admin), which also funded the server for 6 months. This would be the first end portal that TWISTEDINSANE acquired. There was also a "void chunk" where they removed bedrock and several large builds. This was also the base where the "glass shulker incident" occured which would later result in UoP starting a larp war with zxnyy, the perpetrator of the incident. After UoPIV was griefed in February (?) of 2022, Uop V was founded.
