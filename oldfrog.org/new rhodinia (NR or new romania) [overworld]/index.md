## Description
Zxnyy's 2022 base. Originally started as a solo base, zxnyy built a greek-style temple atop large artificial plateau to house his mapart collection. 
After a few months, mostly out of boredom, zxnyy invited some friends who had recently started playing again after "quitting" following the dissolution of Moo.
The base had a small museum, mapart gallery, and a large auto sorter built by TheRampager24/Wail. There was also a slime farm, gold farm, and 2 maparts by zxnyy there.
Most of the other members didn't build very much at the base (mostly because it was griefed a week after they were invited).
\
Zxnyy had previously earned himself a negative reputation with the Union of Peace (UoP) after the Glass Shulker Incident (refer to UoP IV), and only made things worse for himself after inciting drama and griefing a few milestones built by UoP. 
After this, UoP was fed up with Zxnyy's antics and conspired with steelrain815 and NinjaOverSurge to grief NR. This was the end of the Zxnyy x UoP saga.

## Additional Info
Zxnyy grinded many gsets for his shop here.\
Zxnyy retired to spawn and didn't make another base until 2024.\
This world-download was originally made public in a moved form (all region files were moved to 0, 0), so this recovered offset is a bit wrong, leading to all blocks being moved ~3 in X and ~1 in Z. Sub-chunk offsets are not easily possible with readily available tools.
